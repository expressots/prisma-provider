# Pull Request Guidelines

Our guidelines for submitting a pull request.

## Before submitting a Pull Request, please make sure you have verified the following:

- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines:
  - A good commit message should be two things: meaningful and concise. It should not contain every single detail, describing each changed line—we can see all the changes in Git—but, at the same time, it should say enough to avoid ambiguity.
  - We use Microverse's commit message convention
  - The convention stablish that a commit message has to be in the present tense, imperative and lowercase.
  - Example: `fix typo in README.md`
- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)
- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)
